# Introduction {background-color="var(--background)"}

## My backgorund

## Why Are We Here Today?

**Goals**  

- Exchange experiences, solutions, and challenges  

- Share some of my own lessons from teaching R 

- Explore possible approaches for your teaching hurdles  

**Limitations**  

- The workshop is shaped strongly by my own experiences and by my lab’s context 

- Every course setting is unique, and your teaching style may differ from mine

- This is the first round of this workshop


## Course structure


## Challenges in Teaching R

**Low student motivation due to**

- Lack of intrinsic interest in learning a programming language  

- Little to no prior experience with programming  

- Unclear understanding of why this is a relevant skill  

- Expectation that it will be difficult to learn  

**Structural challenges**

- Students have very heterogeneous background knowledge  

- Inconsistent use of statistical software across labs and courses  

- Limited time available to teach R  

- Large number of students in each course

- Missing resources to provide individual feedback 



## Getting to know each other

**Please share briefly:**

- Your name, university, and current role

- What you hope to gain from this workshop  

- One challenge (big or small) you or your lab experience when teaching R

(My) Mindset
:::
# Mindset{background-color="var(--background)"}

## Personal lessons learned I

**Structure**

- Set realistic teaching goals --- and stick to them

- Recognize that seminar structure strongly shapes student mindset

- Provide sufficient support: resources, exercises, and constructive feedback 

**Communication**

- Be transparent and straightforward in communication  

- You set the tone --- be aware of your influence  

- When reacting to background issues, explain openly when and why  


## Personal lessons learned II

**Feedback & change:**

- Refine the course each semester (step by step)

- Try new approaches; don’t repeat what didn’t work

- Always seek feedback (from the whole class, in presence)

- Feedback can hurt, share your experience with others

- Take feedback seriously, but always consider the context  

  - What caused it? What can I do to improve the situation?  
  
- Small adjustments can make a big difference  

## Teaching R means teaching a language

- **Syntax = grammar**  
- **Functions = vocabulary** 
- Practice, practise, practise, ....  

- Do not forget to teach **all** of the basics

- **Balance the three key skills:**
  - Reading code  
  - Debugging (learning to help yourself)  
  - Writing code  

- **Design exercises with intention:** 
  - Order tasks by difficulty and prior knowledge  
  - Match exercise types to specific skills  
  - Mix very simple with more complex tasks  
  - Scaffold step by step towards realistic, real-world problems  

## Programming means failing

> *“Experienced programmers don’t fail less — they just recover faster.”*  

- **Normalize failure**
  - e.g., debug code live, mention common errors
  
- **Encourage self-help strategies first** 
  - Demonstrate practical debugging techniques  
  - How do I read package documentations?
  
  
## Increasing student motivation

- **Connect to relevance**
  - Show exciting examples of what students will be able to do by the end of the course 
  - Highlight how R is needed for projects, research, and the curriculum  
  - Show the broader potential of R beyond statistics  
  - Use diagnostic or test questions to give students with prior knowledge realistic feedback on their level  

- **Make it "fun"**
  - Playful or surprising examples
    - e.g., art with ggplot, scatterplot dinosaurs
  - Interesting themes (even fun column names can help)  

- **Support motivation through feedback**
  - Timely, constructive, and encouraging feedback  

## R basics

**Foundations**  
- Variables  

- [Data types]{.inline-red-highlight} 

- Comments vs. code  

- [Missing values]{.inline-red-highlight}

- [Functions & arguments]{.inline-red-highlight} 

- Reading and writing data sets  

**Programming skills**  
- Flexible vs. hard coding  
- Control structures (loops, if–else)  
- Understand error messages
- debugging skills

**Working with R**  
- R projects  
- R scripts & R Markdown  
- R packages (*Who writes R packages?*) 

**base R vs dplyr**

**visualisations in ggplot**

And THEN, what you actually want to teach ... 😉

Approaches and resources
:::
# Approaches and resources{background-color="var(--background)"}


## Simulate your own data sets

Tailor your data sets to exactly what you need.

**Useful functions:**  
- `rnorm()` – generate normal-distributed values  
- `runif()` – generate uniform random values  
- `sample()` – draw random samples  
- `rbinom()` – simulate binary outcomes  
- `rexp()`, `rgamma()`, etc. – simulate from other distributions  
- `expand.grid()` – create all combinations of factors 


**useful packages:**

- [faux]("https://scienceverse.github.io/faux/")
- [fabricatr]("https://declaredesign.org/r/fabricatr/")
- [messy]("https://nrennie.rbind.io/messy/")
- [truffle]("https://mmmdata.io/posts/2025/08/creating-messy-datasets-for-teaching-purposes-with-truffle/") --- not on CRAN


## Examples: A quick data set

```{r}
library(dplyr)

set.seed(42)

n <- 80
df <- tibble(
  subject = 1:n,
  age = sample(18:70, n, replace = TRUE),
  height  = rnorm(n, mean = 170, sd = 10),
  group   = sample(c("control", "treatment"), n, replace = TRUE)
) %>%
  mutate(
    score = rnorm(n, mean = ifelse(group == "treatment", 75, 70), sd = 5),
    response = rnorm(n, mean = 50, sd = 10)
  )

df %>% head()

```

## Correlated data

```{r}
library("MASS")
set.seed(123)

# Define the mean vector
mean_vector <- c(0, 2, 1.8)

# Define the covariance matrix
cov_matrix <- matrix(c(
  1.00, 0.22, 0.10,
  0.22, 1.00, 0.80,
  0.10, 0.80, 1.00
), nrow = 3, byrow = TRUE)

# Generate n correlated random numbers
n <- 200
correlated_data <- mvrnorm(n, mu = mean_vector, Sigma = cov_matrix)

# Convert to a data frame and add column names
correlated_data <- data.frame(correlated_data)
names(correlated_data) <- c("fitness_level", "sport", "health")

# Calculate the correlations
round(cor(correlated_data), 2)
```


## Constructive Alignment

> *Teaching, learning, and assessment should all point in the same direction.*

**Intended learning outcomes**  
- What should students be able to do? 
  - What specific R skills should students be able to demonstrate?  
  - e.g., import a dataset, run a regression, visualize results

**Teaching & learning activities**  
- How will they practice and engage with the content? 
- e.g., exercises at home, debugging code from other students, projects with real data) 

**Assessment**  
- How will they demonstrate achievement of the outcomes?  
- e.g., open book exams, oral explanations, ...


## Constructive Alignment – Background

- Developed by John Biggs (1996)  
- Based on the idea that students **construct their own learning**  
- The role of the teacher: **design learning environments** that support this process  
- Alignment means:  
  - Learning outcomes define what students should achieve  
  - Teaching activities give opportunities to practice  
  - Assessment measures achievement of outcomes 

## Alternative exams

**Open-book exams**  
- Debug or correct given code  
- Extend existing scripts with new functionality  
- Explain what code does (or why it fails)  
- Interpret error messages  
- Use R’s help system to solve a task with a new function  

**Data science contest**  
- Students have to analyze a (simulated) data set
  - use *personas* to create variability
  - teaches also the meaning of QRPs & p-hacking
- Students compete to produce the best talk/analysis/visualization
- Students have to detect the "bad sheeps"
- Encourages creativity, real-world problem-solving, and communication of results


## Flipped Classroom – The Concept

- Traditional order is reversed:  
  - Students first engage with new material at home (videos, readings, tutorials)  
  - Class time is used for practice, discussion, problem-solving  
- Emphasizes **active learning** rather than passive listening  
- Teacher role shifts from “lecturer” to **facilitator/coach**  

## Flipped Classroom – When & Why It Works

**Useful when:**  
- Content can be learned at different paces 
- Class time is valuable for **collaboration and feedback** 

**Success factors:**
  - Clear, well-structured pre-class materials  
  - Accountability (e.g., small quizzes, short reflections)  
  - In-class activities tightly linked to pre-class work

## Flipped Classroom – Challenges

- **Students may be unprepared in class**
- **High effort for instructors:**
  - Preparing quality pre-class materials (texts, videos, exercises)  
  - Designing effective in-class activities can be difficult 

- **Requires a cultural shift:**  
  - Students expect “being taught” in class  
  - Teachers must let go of content delivery
  - Teachers mus be "strict"


## ChatGPT as a student

**Opportunities**  
- Coding assistant
  - explanations, examples, debugging, feedback 
- Practice problems, synthetic datasets  
- Compare and critique AI vs. own solutions

**Dangers**
- Cheating
- AI usage prevents learning
- No critical thinking

**Ground rules** 
- Specific to the seminar
  - e.g., only valid if explicitly allowed, only for explanations
- Only allow solutions taught in the course

**Explicit usage**
- Use AI for some homework explicitly
  - Warning: only in later stages
- Live demos in class
  - evaluating AI answers  
- Critical thinking
  - correctness, efficiency, relevance 


## ChatGPT as a teacher

- Efficiency first
  - save time for what matters most (teaching & feedback)  
- Friendlier, more constructive feedback phrasing  
- Generate exercises, code examples, explanations  
- Alternative wordings of concepts (multiple ways to explain)  
- Adapt exercises to different levels (beginner → advanced)
- ...
